# Recreation of java.util.ArrayList

Author: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

This project recreates the java.util.ArrayList class in two different ways, and uses a simple store inventory example to test them both.

## [Alist](https://github.com/jackr276/Recreation-of-java.util.ArrayList-2-ways/blob/main/src/AList.java)
This class provides a rebuilt ArrayList using an array as the internal data structure.

## [LList](https://github.com/jackr276/Recreation-of-java.util.ArrayList-2-ways/blob/main/src/LList.java)
This class provides a rebuilt ArrayList using a linked list as the internal data structure.

## [Inventory](https://github.com/jackr276/Recreation-of-java.util.ArrayList-2-ways/blob/main/src/Inventory.java)
This class is meant to simulate a store's inventory system. It makes use of both AList and LList and helps to display the advantages/disadvantages of both methods of ArrayList implementation.
